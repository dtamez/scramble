# Scramble Square Solver

## How To Use

1.  Number the 9 peices 1 through 9 or A through I on the back of each tile making sure to note which side is the bottom.
2.  Give values to the matching portions for each type of object in your puzzle so that they add up to 10.  For example, in the hummingbirds version of the puzzle you might give a value of
    1. to all of the red heads and a value of 9 to all the red tails
    2. to all of the blue heads and a value of 8 to all the blue tails
    3. to all of the pale green heads and a value of 7 to all the pale green tails
    4. to all of the bright green heads and a value of 6 to all the bright green tails

3.  Modify the main() function so that values for each tile match the numbering you've given to your peices.
4.  Run the program and you'll have all possible solutions printed out in under a second.
